# Think-Python-Solutions-
Hi! I'm creating a repo of solutions for the book "Think Python - How to think like a computer scientist" by Allen B.Downey from O'Reilly.

The entire code is presented in interactive Jupyter Notebooks, and is my own creation.

I'm a novice - as such, my code reflects that. Be warned!
